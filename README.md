## My process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5
  - CSS

### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I've practiced some semantic HTML and CSS. The following snippets are some examples of the knowledges I used.

  - Semantic HTML5 (```<ol>```):

```
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the Order <a href="#">Tracking page</a>.</li>
          <li>Enter your order number and email address.</li>
          <li>Click on the Track Order button to view the current status of your shipment.</li>
        </ol>
```

  - CSS (```<ol>, <ul>```):
```
ol, ul {
  padding-left: 1.1rem;
  line-height: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

Seeing how simple it is to use and style list, I will continue to master those techniques in other projects.
